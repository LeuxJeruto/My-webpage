                <h4>My journey as a software engineer</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>My career started in 2017 when I joined the Multimedia University of Kenya to 
                    pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Technology. I did my first project in 2017 
                    with only HTML and CSS. In 2018, I advanced to learning javascript and I created a 
                    website with HTML, CSS, and JS. In 2020 I created another website with the same 
                    languages. Having understood HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS, I learned a bit 
                    of PHP in 2020. In my final year project, I created an eCommerce website using HTML, 
                    CSS SCSS, PHP, and JS. After graduation, I ventured into the design field where I 
                    learned about design principles. I created prototypes using Figma, I also designed 
                    UX and UIs for various applications.Having the basic skills and principles in design
                    and development, I am venturing into my favorite field in technology: DevSecOps. 
                    Currently, I am working towards becoming an excellent DevOps engineer. So far I 
                    have gained skills in Python framework Django and JS, creating CI/CD pipelines, and Gitlab. 
                    I hope to be an excellent DevSecOps engineer someday

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        Reverse engineering and building basic prototypes first
                    <br>
                    I create prototypes first to get a rough final product. Then 
                    I tear the project apart and start building piece by piece. The prototype 
                    gives me a guidance on what I need to do after what. I break the code into 
                    smaller pieces then i determine why this portion works the way it does.

                    <p>
                        After learning the basics and gaining the foundation of software engineering,
                        I want to work on DevOps for the next two years. Then I will enter the DevSecOps field 
                        after learning cybersec and security matters of applications. 
                        <br>
                        Apart from working on my projects, I would love to be a part of a team to learn from others, 
                        collaborate and obtain more skills in this field.
